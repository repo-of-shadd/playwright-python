# playwright-python
A practice project with Playwright in Python. 

Setting up the environment
--------------------------

1. Get the latest version of Python from [here]([url](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/)https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/).
2. Install Python and add to Path from Environment Variables.
3. Get a good IDE. I used PyCharm (it's good and super easy to use for python)
4. Install Playwright. For that open terminal and run **pip install pytest-playwright**
5. After that, install browsers and dependencies for Playwright by running **playwright install**


That's all you'll need. Enjoy!
